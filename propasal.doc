AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED SMART
‘DISCIPLINE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM’
I.INTRODUCTION
"The cost of discipline is always less than the price of regret. So self-discipline is the biggest investment" said Dr.A.P.J.AbdulKalam. Incorporating discipline among students can inculcate professionalism in their behaviour. Surveillance is the monitoring of behaviour, for the purpose of information gathering, influencing, managing or directing. This can include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment, such as closed-circuit television (CCTV), or interception of electronically transmitted information like internet traffic. It can also include simple technical methods, such as human intelligence gathering and interception. There are many different surveillance methods that could lead to information and eventually help in rationalization. The system and equipments used will depend on the type of case being investigated and the level of discretion that needs to be employed.
There is a growing tendency in the world to fit out educational institutions with security equipments such as access control and closed-circuit television systems. This measure is focused on a requirement to provide safety and security to the students during their stay in the educational establishments in accordance with the Primary and Secondary Education and Training Act, as well as in line with other regulatory acts. There are various ways to address the challenge of student discipline inside an education campus. Although, it is possible to arrange manpower to serve as a guard post in order to observe the happenings, these outdated methods are cumbersome. With the advancements in the field of communication technologies, we can employ state-of-the-art technical aids – CCTV and access control systems to serve the purpose.

II.MOTIVATION:
In an educational institution, students become the responsibility of the institute. Currently there are static surveillance systems thatcould only capture and storerecorded surveillance videos.  Thus these systems turn a blind eye to any malicious or indiscipline activity happening around the learning environment and it’s practically difficult to have manpower employed 24/7 for monitoring. So arises a billion dollar question, “Why not incorporate Artificial Intelligence in to surveillance systems to solve the issue?”.Students in general tend to break rules and involve in-disciplinary activities such as loitering, smoking, man-handling etc. These activities are carried out by the students due to the lack of proper physical monitoring and static surveillance systems.

III.EXISTING WORK
(Soh, Rabiatul & Ahmad, Nurazwa 2019) proposed and implemented a video surveillance system in school areas and determined the STEEPV factors and drivers that influencing the uses of CCTV in school compound by using STEEPV analysis tool. The work predicted the future trends of implementing CCTV in school compound by using scenario development that have been determined by using impact-uncertainty analysis. (Gichuhi, Kimani & Ngari, James & Senaji, Thomas 2016) proposed a work that aimed to determine the relationship between CCTV surveillance and employees engagement in commercial banks in Kenya using correlational research. (Martin, Gill & Spriggs, Angela 2005) assessed the impact of CCTV in schools and organization to prevent and reduce criminal cases. (Xu, J 2021) compared the latest approaches to object detection and face recognition and provide reasons why they may or may not be amongst the best to be used in video surveillance applications in terms of both accuracy and speed. It is discovered that Faster R-CNN with Inception ResNet V2 is able to achieve some of the best accuracies while maintaining real-time rates. 

IV.PROPOSED WORK
In educational organizations, the presence of surveillance systems can serve as a reminder for students about the importance of professional behaviour. As the existing static surveillance systems are not capable of incorporating situational awareness across multiple scales of space and time, there is a necessity to incorporate intelligent monitoring system into the surveillance system. This proposed work aims to create a smart surveillance system that aims to assist education community by identifying and providing reliable real –time alerts. 
The proposed Smart Surveillance System intelligently recognizes the students in the remote areas of the campus and provides information to the monitoring system. The intelligence in monitoring system is designed with ability to identify the loitering students around the campus and generate/send alert messages to the monitoring person/control room/concerned authority. Hence, the proposed system would help education organization to monitor the students in order to have a healthy educational environment.As a way of reducing in-disciplinary activities,and enhance the professionalism in education system, it is important to imbibe artificial intelligence in surveillance systems.




 	


 



Figure .1 System architecture
The proposed system architecture represented in Figure.1 consists of the following five modules.
a) VIDEO CAPTURING MODULE:
The CCTV (high resolution) captures the live video stream from the designated location. The video stream from the surveillance systems are converted in to image frames at pre-defined intervals.
	
b) FACE DETECTION MODULE:
Detecting and tracking objects are among the most prevalent and challenging tasks that a surveillance system has to accomplish in order to determine meaningful events and suspicious activities. Background subtraction and image segmentation techniques are used to detect of student images. Haar cascade classifier detects the face and extracts the features. The extracted Haar features serve as an input to the face recognition module. The segmented image is given as input to the face recognition module.
c) FACE RECOGNITION MODULE:
The proposed system requires storing the biometric database of all the enrolled students to train the AI model. The database stores the images of the students in order to extract and represent the facial features. The detected student face is processed by the face recognition algorithms to retrieve the face ID of the enrolled student. With the retrieved face ID, all the other particulars of the students are automatically fetched from the database. These data serve as an input to the loiter detection module to make decision on alert generation. 

d) LOITER DETECTION SYSTEM:
Once the face ID and all the particulars of the student are fetched, the academic schedule of the respective student is traced. The “loiter detection” module validates the current state by processing and checking the schedule with the tracked student.If the system finds any breach of discipline that the student loiters during a scheduled agenda, a trigger is generated to the event generation module.
e) EVENT GENERATION MODULE
This module generates an alert as a sign of signalling an immoral activity to the concerned authority/ control center. If there no violation is found, the system ignores the situation and does not generate an alert.
V. EXPECTED OUTCOMES
The proposed smart surveillance system aims to achieve the following outcomes.
•	Facilitate the students to focus on their responsibilities and move towards value added activities inside the campus.
•	Surveillance enhanced with intelligence can increase the confidence for the institution due to the versatility of intelligent monitoring system.
•	As a leap towards the inculcation of moralities to the students, these systems will gradually develop a sense of self-responsibility among them.
•	The proposed smart system will expedite a healthy educational environment through timely intervention in case of immoral behaviour and hence improve the productivity.
•	The system will have a profound impact on the education community and ultimately benefits the society and the nation.
